# AWS-DeepRacer

This repository contains the code and configurations for training an AWS DeepRacer model on the Ace Speedway track. The model uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to complete the track in under 2 minutes. A custom reward function encourages smooth driving by penalizing zig-zag behavior and rewarding progress.

The goal is to optimize the model to achieve efficient lap completion while experimenting with reinforcement learning techniques.
